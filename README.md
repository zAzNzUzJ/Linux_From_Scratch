# Linux_From_Scratch
Starting the Journey with Linux From Scratch (LFS)

LFS project is a learning-oriented module that guides users through the process of creating a custom Linux operating system from the ground up.
Unlike regular distributions that install unnecessary programs, LFS creates a compact system, with minimal installations as small as 200 MB. 
Its flexibility enables users to build a tailored system, much like constructing a house from the ground up.
Additionally, LFS enhances security by allowing users to compile everything from source, apply patches directly, and audit the system as needed.
